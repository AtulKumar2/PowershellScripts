         <h3>I want to get involved!</h3>

         <p>
          This is a list of projects which have curated tasks
          specifically for new contributors. These are a great
          way to get started with a project, or to help share
          the load of working on open source projects.
         </p>

         <p>
          Find a project you'd like to get involved with:

         <ul>
           <li>read the contributor guidelines for the project</li>
           <li>get the project running locally</li>
           <li>leave a message on a task you'd like to work on</li>
           <li>get to work!</li>
         </ul>
         </p>

         <h3>Projects</h3>
         <div id="projects-panel">
         </div>

         <h3>I maintain a project and want to participate!</h3>

         <p>
           We're looking for projects who can take the time out to
           help mentor developers as they get started with
           open source.
         </p>

         <p>
           What sort of tasks are a good fit?

         <ul>
           <li>Tasks should take no longer than a few nights' worth of work</li>
           <li>Tasks should stand alone - avoid core functionality on which other tasks depend</li>
           <li>Tasks should be well described with pointers to help the implementer</li>
         </ul>
         </p>

         <p>
           We suggest the tag <code>up-for-grabs</code>
           but using a different name is also acceptable.
         </p>

         <p>
           If this sounds like you, getting involved is simple:

        <ol>
          <li>Tag bugs and feature requests that would be a good place to start</li>
          <li>Grab the URL to this list of tasks so that others can get to it easily</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/login">Sign in to GitHub</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dahlbyk/up-for-grabs.net#add-your-project">check out the README.</a></li>
